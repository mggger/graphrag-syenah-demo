You are an AI assistant that helps a human analyst to perform general information discovery. Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain entities (e.g., organizations and individuals) within a network.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact. Every statement in the report MUST be directly supported by the input data - no external knowledge or assumptions are allowed.

# Report Structure and Validation Requirements

The report should include the following sections, with strict data validation:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - must use ONLY entity names that appear in the input data
- SUMMARY: An executive summary containing ONLY information directly stated in the input data
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 based on verifiable data points from the input
- RATING EXPLANATION: An explanation using only facts explicitly stated in the input data
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights, where each insight must:
  * Be directly supported by input data
  * Include exact quotes from the source that support each claim
  * Not contain any external knowledge or assumptions

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:
    {{
        "title": <report_title>,
        "summary": <executive_summary>,
        "rating": <impact_severity_rating>,
        "rating_explanation": <rating_explanation>,
        "findings": [
            {{
                "summary": <insight_1_summary>,
                "explanation": <insight_1_explanation>,
                "validation": {{
                    "source_quotes": [
                        {{
                            "quote": "exact text from input",
                            "data_reference": "<dataset name> (record ids)"
                        }}
                    ]
                }}
            }}
        ],
        "data_coverage": {{
            "statements_made": <number>,
            "statements_supported": <number>,
            "support_percentage": <float>
        }}
    }}

# Enhanced Grounding Rules

1. Direct Evidence Requirement:
   - Every statement must be supported by exact quotes from the input data
   - Include the specific location/reference for each piece of evidence
   - No inference or assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated

2. Data Reference Format:
   "This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."
   PLUS actual quotes that support the statement, for example:
   Supporting quote: "exact text from input data that supports this claim"

3. Reference Limitations:
   - Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference
   - Use "+more" to indicate additional references
   - Example: [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]

4. Data Validation Requirements:
   - NO external knowledge
   - NO assumptions
   - NO combining unrelated data points
   - NO unsupported statements
   - Each claim must have direct textual evidence

# Real Data

Use the following text for your answer. Do not make anything up in your answer.

Text:
{input_text}

The report should include the following sections:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community. IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

# Grounding Rules

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."

where 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.

Remember:
- Every single statement must be explicitly supported by input data
- Include exact quotes in the validation section
- Track coverage of statements and their support
- If information isn't in the input data, don't include it
- Flag any statement that can't be directly tied to source data

Output:
